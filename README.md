# Overview

Everyday tasks and chores can be difficult to remember, and this becomes more amplified the further away the task is.
This app makes it easy to keep track of things you need to do, and be reminded to execute them when the time comes.

The app is built with React, supports modern browsers and all reasonable screen sizes.
It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses the [Pure CSS framework](https://purecss.io/) as a base for styling.
